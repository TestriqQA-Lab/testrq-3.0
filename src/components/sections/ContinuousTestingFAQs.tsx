            question:
                "What is the difference between Continuous Testing and Test Automation?",
            answer:
                "While Test Automation refers to the use of tools to execute tests without human intervention, Continuous Testing is the broader process of executing these automated tests as part of a software delivery pipeline to obtain immediate feedback on business risks. Automation is the tool, while Continuous Testing is the strategy.",
        },
        {
            question: "Why is Continuous Testing essential for DevOps?",
            answer:
                "Continuous Testing is essential because it removes the traditional testing bottleneck. In a DevOps environment, where speed is critical, waiting for a manual testing phase is impossible. Continuous Testing ensures that speed does not compromise quality by providing constant, automated validation.",
        },
        {
            question:
                "What are the key components of a Continuous Testing Service?",
            answer:
                "The foundational pillars include Test Automation, CI/CD Integration, Test Data Management, and Environmental Parity. Together, these components ensure that tests are reliable, repeatable, and provide an accurate reflection of production readiness.",
        },
        {
            question:
                "How does continuous testing improve feedback loops?",
            answer:
                "It provides developers with instant results after every code commit. Instead of waiting days for a QA report, developers know within minutes if their changes have introduced a defect, allowing for immediate remediation and significantly lower technical debt.",
        },

            question:

                    Common hurdles include cultural resistance to shared quality
                    responsibility, &ldquo;flaky&rdquo; tests that provide inconsistent
                    results, skill gaps in automation, and the high effort required for
