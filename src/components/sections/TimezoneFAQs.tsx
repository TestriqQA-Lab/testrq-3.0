        question: "What are the benefits of testing in the same time zone?",
        answer: "Testing in the same time zone enables real-time collaboration, faster feedback loops, and immediate defect resolution. It eliminates the communication delays typical of traditional offshore models, ensuring that QA and development remain perfectly synchronized throughout the sprint."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you offer localized support in my region?",
        answer: "Yes, our Time Zone Aligned QA includes localized support across major global regions including North America (EST/PST), Europe (GMT/CET), and Asia-Pacific (IST/SGT/AEST)."
    },
    {
        question: "How does follow-the-sun testing improve software quality?",
        answer: "Follow-the-sun testing provides a 24/7 QA cycle by leveraging teams in different global regions. This allows for continuous testing, where code developed in one region is tested in another while the original team sleeps, significantly reducing the overall testing lifecycle and improving time-to-market."
    },
    {
        question: "Why is real-time collaboration important in software QA?",
        answer: "Real-time collaboration allows testers to clarify requirements instantly, developers to fix bugs as they are found, and stakeholders to have immediate visibility into the product's quality. This synchronous approach reduces misunderstandings, minimizes rework, and fosters a stronger culture of quality."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the difference between onshore, nearshore, and offshore testing?",
        answer: "Onshore testing involves teams in the same country. Nearshore testing involves teams in a neighboring country or the same time zone. Offshore testing involves teams in a distant country with a significant time zone difference. Nearshore and onshore models are preferred for projects requiring high levels of real-time collaboration."
