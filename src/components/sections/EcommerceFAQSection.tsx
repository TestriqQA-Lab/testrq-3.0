      question: "What is the difference between B2B and B2C e-commerce testing?",
      answer: "The difference between B2B and B2C e-commerce testing lies in the complexity of the workflow. B2B testing focuses on bulk ordering, role-based permissions, and dynamic pricing contracts. B2C testing focuses on private user experience (UX), fast checkout flows, and mobile responsiveness."

      question: "How to test payment gateway integration in a sandbox environment?",
      answer: "Conduct payment integration testing in a sandbox environment using authorized test credentials from Stripe, PayPal, or other gateway providers. Validate successful transactions, declined cards, and partial refunds without processing real funds. Our e-commerce testing services ensure that the communication between your store and the gateway's API is error-free."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is PCI DSS compliance important for my online store?",
      answer: "PCI DSS compliance is a global security standard required for any business that processes credit card data. Failure to comply can lead to massive fines and the loss of your ability to process payments. Our website testing services include security audits that help you remain audit-ready."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the best practices for testing mobile shopping applications?",
      answer: "Best practices for testing mobile shopping applications include private 'thumb-friendly' UI, testing under variable network conditions (3G/5G), and validating push notification performance. We utilize a real device cloud to ensure your app works on the latest iOS and Android versions."
    },
    {
      question: "How does performance testing prevent cart abandonment?",
      answer: "Studies show a 1-second delay results in a 7% drop in conversions. Performance testing identifies database and server bottlenecks before they impact your customers. This ensures a fast checkout experience, even during massive traffic spikes."
