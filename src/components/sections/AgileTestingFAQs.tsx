            question: "What are the core principles of Agile testing?",
            answer: "The core principles of Agile testing include continuous feedback, collaboration between testers and developers, testing early and often (shift-left), and focusing on delivering value to the customer through iterative improvements."
        },
        {
            question: "How does Agile testing differ from traditional waterfall testing?",
            answer: "Unlike waterfall testing, which occurs at the end of the development cycle, Agile testing is integrated into every stage of the process. It is iterative, collaborative, and focuses on continuous quality rather than a single final sign-off."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the role of a QA tester in an Agile team?",
            answer: "In an Agile team, a QA tester is a collaborative partner who helps define requirements, provides continuous feedback, develops automated tests, and ensures that the final product meets the user's needs and expectations."
        },
        {
            question: "How to integrate automated testing into Agile sprints?",
            answer: "Integrating automation into Agile sprints requires a focus on building maintainable scripts, prioritizing high-value test cases, and ensuring that automated tests are executed as part of the continuous integration (CI) pipeline."
