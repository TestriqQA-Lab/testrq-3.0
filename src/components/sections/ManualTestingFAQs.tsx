      question: "Why is manual testing still important in 2026?",
      answer:
        (
          <>
            AI is rising, but <Link href='blog/post/the-future-of-manual-testing-adapting-in-an-automated-world'>manual testing</Link> remains vital. It handles exploratory work and complex logic. This is where &apos;human-in-the-loop&apos; intuition is vital for finding what scripts miss. It fills the &quot;coverage gaps&quot; that <Link href='automation-testing-services'>automation</Link> cannot reach in complex micro-services architectures.

        ),
    },
    {
      question: "How does ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 improve manual testing?",
      answer:
        (<>This international standard provides a structured, risk-based framework. This standard ensures manual testing is never ad-hoc. It follows a repeatable process for planning, design, and reporting. This approach increases visibility for stakeholders and makes your software more reliable.</>),
    },
    {
      question: "Can manual testing fit into a CI/CD pipeline?",
      answer:
        (<>Yes. We use the ISO 29119-2 standard to create repeatable test processes. This allows us to sync manual regression with your fast release cycles. You get high-quality results without losing speed.</>),
    },
    {
      question: "What is the cost of outsourcing manual testing?",
      answer:
        "Outsourcing manual testing is more cost-effective than building an in-house team. It removes the extra costs of tool licensing and specialized training. Plus, it makes it easier to scale during busy development periods.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does Testriq provide manual testing for mobile apps?",
      answer:
        (<>Yes, we offer <Link href='mobile-application-testing'>manual testing for both iOS and Android</Link>. We use real devices from our global farm to ensure your app works across all OS versions and screen sizes.</>),
