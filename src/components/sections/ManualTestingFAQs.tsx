      question: "What is manual testing and why is it important?",
      answer:
        "Manual testing is a software testing approach where human testers manually execute test cases without relying on automation tools. It's essential for identifying usability issues, user experience problems, and edge cases that automated testing often overlooks. Manual testing brings a human perspective, ensuring applications are intuitive, accessible, and aligned with real-world user expectations.",
    },
    {
      question: "When should I choose manual testing over automated testing?",
      answer:
        "Manual testing is ideal for exploratory testing, usability testing, ad-hoc testing, and scenarios requiring human judgment. Choose manual testing when you need to test user interfaces, evaluate user experience, perform accessibility testing, or when test cases are executed infrequently. It's also preferred for complex scenarios that require human intuition, creative thinking, or when the application is in early development stages with frequent changes.",
    },
    {

    },
    {
      question: "How long does a typical manual testing project take?",
      answer:
        "The duration of manual testing projects varies based on application complexity, scope, and requirements. Simple applications may require 1-2 weeks, while complex enterprise applications can take 4-8 weeks or more. We provide detailed project timelines during our initial assessment, considering factors like the number of features, platforms to test, test case complexity, and your specific quality requirements.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the cost of manual testing services?",

    },
    {
      question:
        "How do you handle confidential and sensitive data during testing?",

Our team members undergo security training, and we use anonymized test data whenever possible. We also provide detailed security reports and maintain audit trails for all testing activities.",
    },
    {
