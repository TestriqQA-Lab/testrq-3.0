            question: "What are compatibility testing services?",
            answer: "Compatibility testing services ensure that a software application or system functions correctly across various operating systems, browsers, hardware configurations, network environments, and devices. This verifies that the application delivers a consistent user experience regardless of the platform it is used on."
        },
        {
            question: "Why is compatibility testing important for software?",
            answer: "It is crucial for preventing poor user experiences, reducing customer churn, and avoiding revenue loss due to application malfunctions. It ensures that software reaches a wider audience, maintains brand reputation, and operates reliably across the diverse technological landscape users employ."
        },
        {
            question: "What are the types of compatibility testing?",
            answer: "Key types include Browser Compatibility Testing, Operating System Compatibility Testing, Mobile Device Compatibility Testing, Hardware Compatibility Testing, Network Compatibility Testing, Backward Compatibility Testing (with older versions), and Forward Compatibility Testing (with newer versions)."
        },
        {
            question: "How to perform compatibility testing for mobile apps?",
            answer: "It involves testing across a wide range of real mobile devices, operating systems (iOS and Android), and versions. This includes checking app functionality, UI responsiveness, performance, and user experience on different screen sizes, resolutions, and network conditions."
        },
        {
            question: "What are the best tools for compatibility testing?",
            answer: "Popular choices include BrowserStack, Sauce Labs, and LambdaTest for cross-browser and cross-device testing. For mobile apps, tools like Appium and dedicated cloud-based mobile device labs are highly effective. Automated tools like Selenium and Cypress are also frequently integrated."
