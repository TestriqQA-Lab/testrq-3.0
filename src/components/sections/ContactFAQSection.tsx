        "For urgent QA issues, we recommend calling our direct support line at +1 (555) 012-3456 during business hours (9 AM â€“ 6 PM EST). For critical production issues, our 24/7 emergency QA support is available.

    {
      question: "Do you offer free consultations?",
      answer:
        "Yes! We offer free 15-minute consultations to discuss your QA needs and provide initial recommendations. For more detailed discussions, we also offer 45-minute deep dive sessions and 90-minute team workshops. You can schedule any of these through our Calendly integration.",

    {
      question: "Can I schedule a meeting outside of regular business hours?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely! While our standard hours are Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 6 PM EST, we understand that different time zones and schedules require flexibility. When booking through Calendly, you can request alternative times, and we'll do our best to accommodate your schedule.",
    },
    {
      question: "What information should I include when contacting you?",
      answer:
        "To help us provide the most relevant assistance, please include: your company name and industry, a brief description of your current testing challenges or needs, your project timeline and urgency level, and any specific technologies or platforms you're working with. The more details you provide, the better we can tailor our response.",

    },
    {
      question: "Is there a cost for initial consultations or quotes?",
      answer:
        "Initial consultations and project quotes are completely free. We believe in providing value upfront and helping you understand how we can assist your QA needs before any commitment. Detailed project scoping and custom solution development may involve fees, which we'll discuss transparently.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if my message was received?",
