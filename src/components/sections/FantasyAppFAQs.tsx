      question: "What is fantasy app certification and why does it matter?",
      answer:
        "Fantasy app certification is a structured validation process to ensure your platform meets industry standards for fair play, security, privacy, and performance. It helps build user trust, ensures regulatory compliance, mitigates fraud risks, and improves app store rankings—especially for real-money and competitive gameplay environments.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the fantasy app certification process take?",
      answer:
        "The full process typically takes 12–18 working days. This includes assessment (2–3 days), comprehensive testing (7–10 days), security audit (3–5 days), and certification issuance (1–2 days). Timelines may vary depending on your app’s features, complexity, and current compliance level.",
    },
    {
      question: "What regulations and standards do you certify against?",
      answer:
        "We certify fantasy apps against ISO 27001 (Security), ISO 27701 (Privacy), GDPR, CCPA, OWASP, and SOC 2 standards. We also validate fairness algorithms, KYC compliance, payment integration security, and region-specific data localization policies to meet gaming authority expectations.",
    },
    {
      question: "What types of testing are included in the certification?",
      answer:
        "Certification includes security testing (VAPT, OWASP, API hardening), performance testing (load & stress), gameplay logic validation, API and backend testing, UI/UX evaluation, compliance checks, and fraud prevention audits to ensure platform reliability during live contests.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does certification for a fantasy app cost?",
      answer:
        "Costs depend on your platform size, compliance scope, and feature set. We offer affordable packages for startups and enterprise-grade plans for real-money gaming apps. Most clients recover the investment within 3–6 months through improved user retention and trust.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you provide post-certification support?",
      answer:
        "Yes. We provide 24/7 monitoring, periodic audits, recertification, and incident response. Our support includes fair play audits, fraud alert monitoring, regulatory updates, and team training to keep your app compliant and secure long-term.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you help with compliance in multiple regions?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. We support cross-jurisdictional compliance including GDPR (EU), CCPA (USA), India’s data rules, and regional fairness laws. Whether you're targeting a global or localized audience, we align your platform to meet legal and ethical standards in all markets.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if issues are found during the certification process?",
      answer:
        "We provide detailed remediation steps and collaborate with your developers to fix issues. Once resolved, we perform retesting to ensure compliance. Our phased approach helps prioritize critical fixes while minimizing launch delays.",
