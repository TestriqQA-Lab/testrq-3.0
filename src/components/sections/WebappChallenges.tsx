            "Mobile devices now account for over 58% of global web traffic. Testing across endless combinations of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox has become a logistical nightmare for QA teams. Layout bugs and inconsistent UX often lead to high churn rates.",
        solution:
            "Our Solution: We align with ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2:2021, utilizing multi-environment validation and Responsive design testing. Our cross-browser checklist ensures your app performs flawlessly. We cover everything from legacy desktop browsers to the latest mobile operating systems.",

        description:
            "Dynamic UIs and AI-driven changes have made traditional Web UI automation brittle. Over 80% of automated tests fail because of 'flakiness' in dynamic environments. Maintenance of Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright scripts often takes longer than the testing itself.",
        solution:
            "Our Solution: We implement ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-4 model-based testing. Our automated testing ensures stability during Agile sprints. We use self-healing scripts that analyze the DOM in real-time to prevent broken tests.",

        description:
            "Rapid CI/CD pipelines often leave edge cases untested. This gap contributed to the 83% spike in application attacks seen in early 2026. Manual QA often misses real-user scenarios under the pressure of short development cycles.",
        solution:
            "Our Solution: We mandate strict documentation per ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3:2021. Our web app QA testing maintains full traceability from requirements to incident reports. This rigorous approach ensures zero coverage gaps, even during 48-hour release cycles.",
